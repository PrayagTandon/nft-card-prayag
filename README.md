## My process

1. First defined the font-size for the html element to 62.5% which comes out to be 10px for a default 16px font-size of the browser. This helped me to size the elemnets using rem units and made calculation easy.

2. Tried to make the content more semantically sound, So used semantic HTML5 elements such as <main> , <section> etc.. instead of generic container such as <div> .

3. Made use of Chrome dev tools to align the elements perfectly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. How to display a colr block over an image in a hover state.

2. The position:absolute property.

3. How to select breakpoints to apply media queries.
